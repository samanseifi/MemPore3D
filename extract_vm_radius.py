"""
Extracts simulation data from .npz files into human-readable CSV files.

This script processes a list of .npz files. For each input file, it
creates two output .csv files:
1.  One for the membrane potential (Vm) vs. time.
2.  One for the pore radius vs. time.

Usage:
    python extract_to_csv.py
    (Modify the 'npz_files' list in the script to point to your files)
